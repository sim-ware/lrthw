# Q: Write a script that more arguments. Make sure you give the unpacked
#    variables good names.
first, second, third, fourth = $stdin.gets.chomp

puts "Your first variable is #{first}."
puts "Your second variable is #{second}."
puts "Your third variable is #{third}."
puts "Your fourth variable is #{fourth}."

# Bit confused here, seems to only allow $stdin.gets.chomp to take only one
# argument.
